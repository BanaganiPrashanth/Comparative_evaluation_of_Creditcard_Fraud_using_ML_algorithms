# Comparative_evaluation_of_Creditcard_Fraud_using_ML_algorithms

  The CCF detection problem is a challenging and important issue for financial institutions and individuals.Detecting credit card fraud is an extremely important issue in the financial sector, as it results in significant financial losses and negatively impacts customer trust. The main motive of CCFD is to develop methods to identify fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently. This research typically involves the use of statistical and machine-learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of transaction data. In this study, we have evaluated four different ML models (ANN, LR, DT, and SVM) on a dataset for CCF detection in R programming language.

  Our experimental results demonstrate that the LR model has the highest overall accuracy (94.86%) as well as the highest sensitivity (98.97%). However, the ANN model has a slightly lower accuracy (94.38%) but has the highest F1-score (94.52%). F1 score is an important metric to consider when choosing the best model for classification problems because The F1 score is a suitable metric to assess a model's overall performance because it combines precision and recall into a single measure that accounts for the trade-off between them. It gives more weight to the lower value of precision or recall, making it a more appropriate metric when the dataset contains an unequal distribution of positive and negative cases because it considers both precision and recall, which are crucial for accurately classifying imbalanced data.
